# Python Developer Assessment
# Python Developer Assessment

This repository contains my developer assessment tasks for Python development.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates my skills in Python programming, Git version control, debugging, API interaction, and coding best practices through a series of tasks.

## Tasks Completed

- [Task 1.2 - Git Basics](book_store.py)  
- [Task 1.3 - Code Style](bad_style.py)  
- [Task 2.1 - Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)](dsa_challenges.py)  
- [Task 2.2 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](book_store.py)  
- [Task 2.3 - Debugging Errors](debug_errors.py)  
- [Task 3.1 - API Interaction](api_client.py)  
- [Additional Hello World Example](hello.py)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmulyaKata/python-dev-assessment.git
   ## Reflections

### Challenges
Managing merge conflicts and ensuring code style consistency were some challenges I faced during this assessment.

### Interesting Parts
Interacting with APIs and handling error debugging was particularly engaging and helped me understand real-world scenarios better.

### Learnings
I improved my Git skills (branching, merging, and resolving conflicts) and deepened my understanding of Python debugging and OOP concepts.
